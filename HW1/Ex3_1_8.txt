Gaussian elimination in algorithm 3.1.6 has time complexity O(n^3) with 
    3 nested loops. This is only for this algorithm specifically and through some 
    searching, I found that other algorithms that perform Gauss-Jordan 
    elimination exist that are relatively recent discoveries in combinatorial 
    mathematics.
This post led me down a rabbit hole of trying to understand logarithmic time
    in terms of sequences:
